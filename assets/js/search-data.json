Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: Functions and methods . Why are procedures effective?: Convenient to change errors, ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Additional Notes . procedures are functions | procedures simplify programs | procedures split tasks into individual components that need to be done | procedures have parameters (what the procedure is going to work on/convert/etc) | seperating program to procedures in order to simplify it is called modularity | . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . num = 7 def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num # Driver Code convert(num) . 0111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . findMax = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&gt;numberB) { max = numberA; } else { max = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The max is &quot; + max); }; findMin = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&lt;numberB) { min = numberA; } else { min = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The min is &quot; + min); }; findMax(2,3) findMin(6,10) . The max is 3 The min is 6 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num def wordtobin(word): word = str(word) list = [] for letter in word: list.append(letter) for item in list: index = list.index(item) new = ord(item) list[index] = new for i in list: z = list.index(i) new = convert(i) list[int(z)] = new word = input(&quot;What word would you like to convert to binary?&quot;) print(word, &quot; to binary is:&quot;) wordtobin(word) .

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a _dictionary__. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is _O(1) or constant__. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # set() returns the values that are unique. Duplicated values are left out. # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # Sets and keys are similar in that they must be unique. . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

For Mr. Yeung&#39;s class: Justify your favorite Taylor Swift song, answer may effect seed . While Taylor Swift has many noteworthy songs, &quot;Don&#39;t Blame Me&quot; is definitely my favorite for a few reasons. &quot;Don&#39;t Blame Me&quot; exhibits Taylor&#39;s powerful vocals and her incredible range. Her vocal ability in this song was cleverly used to show a range of emotion that can be otherwise difficult to express. Taylor&#39;s genius lyrics such as &quot;My name is whatever you decide, and I&#39;m just gonna call you mine&quot; showcases her ability to express the song&#39;s message of all-consuming love in a masterful way. Additionally, the melody is almost haunting, with heavy bass and precussion, which helps to create a dramatic atmosphere which suits the song&#39;s message perfectly. The song&#39;s multiple aspects allow &quot;Don&#39;t Blame Me&quot; to be a song perfect for any occasion. It&#39;s heavy precussion allow for it to be the perfect workout song, while the passionate lyrics also make it an emotional piece. Overall, I believe &#39;Don&#39;t Blame Me&#39; is the best Taylor Swift Song. .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . In a video game for example, the reaction time of a character has to do with time. Space has to do with how large an image may be for example. At times time and space can be related, a larger image may take a longer time to render. Without considering space time complexity of an algortithm can make it inefficient and take away from the program&#39;s purpose. In addition, not considering complexity can make the program an inconvinience for users. | . Take a look at our lassen volcano example from the data compression tech talk.

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . I think it is both. In this case space and time is related in that a larger image takes a longer time to render, as it didn&#39;t show for a long time. | . Big O Notation . Constant O(1) | Linear O(n) | Quadratic O(n^2) | Logarithmic O(logn) | Exponential (O(2^n)) | . numbers = list(range(1000)) . Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 486 487 488 489 490 491 492 493 494 495 496 497 498 499 500 501 502 503 504 505 506 507 508 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516 517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 525 526 527 528 529 530 531 532 533 534 535 536 537 538 539 540 541 542 543 544 545 546 547 548 549 550 551 552 553 554 555 556 557 558 559 560 561 562 563 564 565 566 567 568 569 570 571 572 573 574 575 576 577 578 579 580 581 582 583 584 585 586 587 588 589 590 591 592 593 594 595 596 597 598 599 600 601 602 603 604 605 606 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 622 623 624 625 626 627 628 629 630 631 632 633 634 635 636 637 638 639 640 641 642 643 644 645 646 647 648 649 650 651 652 653 654 655 656 657 658 659 660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713 714 715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769 770 771 772 773 774 775 776 777 778 779 780 781 782 783 784 785 786 787 788 789 790 791 792 793 794 795 796 797 798 799 800 801 802 803 804 805 806 807 808 809 810 811 812 813 814 815 816 817 818 819 820 821 822 823 824 825 826 827 828 829 830 831 832 833 834 835 836 837 838 839 840 841 842 843 844 845 846 847 848 849 850 851 852 853 854 855 856 857 858 859 860 861 862 863 864 865 866 867 868 869 870 871 872 873 874 875 876 877 878 879 880 881 882 883 884 885 886 887 888 889 890 891 892 893 894 895 896 897 898 899 900 901 902 903 904 905 906 907 908 909 910 911 912 913 914 915 916 917 918 919 920 921 922 923 924 925 926 927 928 929 930 931 932 933 934 935 936 937 938 939 940 941 942 943 944 945 946 947 948 949 950 951 952 953 954 955 956 957 958 959 960 961 962 963 964 965 966 967 968 969 970 971 972 973 974 975 976 977 978 979 980 981 982 983 984 985 986 987 988 989 990 991 992 993 994 995 996 997 998 999 .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0

Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) . [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1], [2, 3], [2], [3], []] . Using the time library, we are able to see the difference in time it takes to calculate the fibonacci function above. . Based on what is known about the other time complexities, hypothesize the resulting elapsed time if the function is replaced. The difference between each time complexity depends on the type of multipler correlated with each. Exponential for example will be greater in time complexity than a multiplier of 5 because of the pattern of its growth. | . import time start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(34)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) start_time = time.time() print(fibonacci(35)) end_time = time.time() total_time = end_time - start_time print(&quot;Time taken:&quot;, total_time, &quot;seconds&quot;) . 5702887 Time taken: 2.4118387699127197 seconds 9227465 Time taken: 3.898521661758423 seconds .

Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. . Bubble Sort: . Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order until the list is sorted. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) Insertion Sort: | Compared each element in turn with the ones before it and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted sequence. The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2). Selection Sort: | This algorithm works by selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted portion until the list is sorted. The time complexity of selection sort is also O(n^2). Binary Sort: | Olog(n) because binary search works by comparing given number to median of data set. Also as the dataset grows, the time complexity grows logarithmically | . Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? . Time and space complexity directly impact the efficiency of an algorithm. The more efficient an algorithm is, the faster and less memory it consumes | If an algorithm has high time and large space complexity, it will become impractical for larger data sets. | . Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? . This is not necessarily true in all cases. Constant time algorithms require less time to run and are eficient however not all problems can be solved with constant algorithms. Some issues may require exponential algorithms to solve it. . What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? . Counting the number of basic operations: The time complexity of an algorithm is proportional to the number of basic operations it performs, like arithmetic operations, assignments, comparisons | Examining nested loops: Nested loops are a common cause of high time complexity. If an algorithm contains nested loops, the time complexity is often proportional to the number of iterations | Recursive calls: If an algorithm makes a large number of recursive calls, the time complexity may be high. | Data structures: The space complexity of an algorithm often depends on the size of the data structures it uses. | If an algorithm contains many conditional statements, the time complexity may be higher. | .

I choose number 3 because there are two independent variables N and M, and the variable sizes dont depend on the size of the input. So must be (N+M) and (1) . int a = 0, b = 0; for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) { a = a + rand(); } for (j = 0; j &lt; M; j++) { b = b + rand(); } . What is the time complexity of the following code: | O(N) | O(N*log(N)) | O(N * Sqrt(N)) | O(N*N) | .

What will be the time complexity of the following code? | O(n) | O(k) | O(logkn) | O(lognk) | . I chose option 3 because as it loops for k^n-1 times, taking the log it becomes logk(n) . int value = 0; for(int i=0;i&lt;n;i++) for(int j=0;j&lt;i;j++) value += 1; . What will be the time complexity of the following code? | n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1) | . I chose option 3 because there is a for loop within another for loop. . Algorithm A and B have a worst-case running time of O(n) and O(logn), respectively. Therefore, algorithm B always runs faster than algorithm A? | True | False | .

            "content": "Introduction . Intro blurb: Climate change and its impact on the planet has become an increasingly pressing issue in recent years. One of the primary contributors to climate change is the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atomsphere, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels for energy. As a result, there is an increased interest in understanding the relationship between a country&#39;s exonomic growth (measured in gross domestic product (GDP)) and its CO2 emissions. By analyzing GDP and emission data from a wide variety of countries, this project aims to provide insights into the correlation of economic growth and carbon emissions, and contribute to the ongoing discussion of imposing climate change policy, specifically on larger contributors. . Why is CO2 so bad anyways? . The release of CO2 into the atmosphere causes heat to be trapped within. This is known as the greenhouse effect. When sunlight reaches the Earth&#39;s surface some of the energy is reflected back to space. CO2 present in the atmosphere will intercept this energy causing the CO2 molecule to experience vibrations. The vibrations are caused due to CO2&#39;s molecular structure, as it is linear containing one carbon atom and two double-bonded oxygens. This linear arrangement creates polarity, and a strong dipole moment, allowing the molecule to react strongly with EM radiation (absorb a signficant amount of energy). The molecule&#39;s absorbed energy transforms into heat. This generated heat is radiated back to the Earth&#39;s surface where it contributes to global warming, or the increase of the planet&#39;s temperature. This temperature rise leads to a number of climate impacts such as sea level rise, intense and frequent heat waves, severe storms, and changes in precipitation patterns. | . Data .

Analysis . Linear Regressions statistics: . CO2 Emissions = 0.3524*GDP - 47.203 | R^2 = 0.907262 | . An r^2 value of approximately 0.91 indicates a very strong, positive correlation between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 Emissions). This means that as a country&#39;s GDP increases, its COS emissions tend to increase as well. . However, strong correlation does not necessarily imply causation. While the data suggests that a strong correlation exists between GDP and CO2 emissions of a country, many other factors such as a country&#39;s level of industrialization and energy mix could impact both factors. . Conclusion, Final Remarks . Nonetheless, the strong correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions highlights the need for effectve climate policies that address the impact of economic growth on the earth. If left unaddressed, CO2 emissions are likely to cause devastatin gimpacts on human populations, ecosystems, and even economies. . Therefore, policymakers must prioritize developing and implementing strategies to reduce carbon emissions while promoting sustainable economic growth. Measures could include transitioning to renewable energy sources (solar, hydro), promoting energy efficiency, and investing in low-carbon infrastructure. . By taking action to address the relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions, we can work towards awareness, and a more sustainable future. .",

Create a new User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL INSERT to add row . Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? create() in the first lesson utilizes object oriented programming while the second one takes a more imperitave approach, based on individual functions. In OOP , large databases stay organized while in Imperitave may become diffucult to navigate and add to after a certain amount of data. However, imperitave is easier to understand and can therefore be easier to work with at times. | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? SQL INSERT inserts data into a specified schema of the table. User init initiallizes the dataset. They are not the same thing. | . import sqlite3 def create(): name = input(&quot;Enter your name:&quot;) uid = input(&quot;Enter your user id:&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter your password&quot;) dob = input(&quot;Enter your date of birth &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;&quot;) # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to insert data into a table cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO users (_name, _uid, _password, _dob) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, uid, password, dob)) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() print(f&quot;A new user record {uid} has been created&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while executing the INSERT:&quot;, error) # Close the cursor and connection objects cursor.close() conn.close() create() . A new user record thehall has been created . Updating a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses SQL UPDATE to modify password . What does the hacked part do? The hacked part ensures that the length of the password is greater than 2. If it is not, the message is updated to hacked. | . Explain try/except, when would except occur? Except would occur when there was a problem connecting to the sqlite database or performing a function on the database . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? Defining conn and cursor is repeated in all of these exmaples, because otherwise a connection to the swlite database can not be formed. . | . import sqlite3 def update(): uid = input(&quot;Enter user id to update&quot;) password = input(&quot;Enter updated password&quot;) if len(password) &lt; 2: message = &quot;hacked&quot; password = &#39;gothackednewpassword123&#39; else: message = &quot;successfully updated&quot; # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() try: # Execute an SQL command to update data in a table cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE users SET _password = ?

Delete a User in table in Sqlite.db . Uses a delete function to remove a user based on a user input of the id. . Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? Yes delete can be a dangerous operation when the database is public because of the fact that people may attempt to wipe the entire database. | What is the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} do? f is a replacement for .format, and allows any variables in the string to automatically be converted into string format.

OOP vs Imperitive . I think for our case imperitive is more effective since we are dealing with a small database. However Object Oriented Programming is more useful for larger database, or is more scalable. . Menu Interface to CRUD operations . CRUD and Schema interactions from one location by running menu. Observe input at the top of VSCode, observe output underneath code cell. . Why does the menu repeat? menu() repeats because menu() is a recurssive function, meaning it calls menu() within itself. | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List?

Interesting... could page numbers and year have a linear correlation? . Quick Overview on Linear Regression : . Basically linear regression&#39;s purpose is to find a line of best fit, to essentially prove linear correlation between an independent variable and a target variable, in this case number of pages and year published. Xtrain, xtest, Ytrain, and ytest are used for machine learning models. Here there is a training set and a testing state. Training set is data we give to the model. Testing set is data unseen by the model. The model makes predictions given the testing data and previous trends it find with the training data. If there is linear correlation, there is high accuracy in the outputs for testing data, which means r2 value should be close to 1 or -1. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.metrics import r2_score # load book data bookdf = pd.read_json(&#39;files/books.json&#39;) # assign seperate variables to pages and years pages = bookdf[&#39;pages&#39;] year = bookdf[&#39;year&#39;] # reshape data so it may be used in linear regression model. Linear regression required a 2D array with one column. pages = np.array(pages).reshape(-1,1) year = np.array(year) # split into training and testing sets of data pages_train, pages_test, year_train, year_test = train_test_split(pages, year, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # create linear regression model and train with traindata regr = LinearRegression() regr.fit(pages_train, year_train) # model is trained, now try some test data year_pred = regr.predict(pages_test) # basically seeing how linear the model is, or how accurate it is r2 = r2_score(year_test, year_pred) print(&quot;R-squared is&quot;, r2) . R-squared is -0.015050410465296427 . What this r value means is that there is poor linear correlation between year and number of pages. Older books are not necessarily lengthier! The two data points we observed in min and max happened to be a coincidence. Corellation does not equal causation. . Files To Get .

The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. .

Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

            "content": "Data Compression Blog . 2.2 Compressing Data Video Notes . Data compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data | Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space | When data is compressed, repeated patterns and predictability | compression can be lossy or lossless... | . Lossy vs Lossless . Lossy data compression: reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guarenteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. (approach used when removal of some data has no effect on the representation of the content) Ex. Graphics, audio, Video, Images | Lossless data compression: reduced the number of bits stored or transmitted while guarenteeing complete reconstruction of the original data (approach used where the loss of data would change the information Ex. text, spreadsheets) | . This could have lossy compression because it is a solid color, so losing specific parts of the image woul dnot affect it&#39;s overall look or function as a blue square: . . This must have lossless compression because it is a detailed picture. With lossy, important parts of the picture may be left out which can change the overall function of the picture: . . In short, if an image is simple it is more likely to use lossy compression than a complicated image since no critical data will be lost in a simple picture | . Compiled Questions from this Notebook . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? . You can use cd which changes directory, ls which lists the content of a directory, rm which deletes a file . What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? . You can use cd to change directory, dir to list the contents of a directory, and del to remove a file . What are some of the major differences? . Terminal uses a &quot;Unix-file&quot; system, meaning many commands that work in terminal will not work with windows. For example the commands for delete and listing the contents of a directory are different with each. Also file paths are different. . Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code. . Originally I was having alot of probems with the images. In the begining the images would not load due to a format issue. The name suffix of the file did not match the file type itself. Then I had issues with the img path. With some research I was able to correct my mistake and realize that my path was calling a non existent file since my image itself was not in the right images folder. Path is very important when working with images because if the program can&#39;t find the image, it can&#39;t run your manipulations. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? . The path is important when working with images because the path is the location of the image file in your system. When you work with images you have to specific the image&#39;s path in order to display it or manipulate it using compression methods. If the path is incorrect you can not work with the image. . How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? . Meta data is the data that provides background information about other data. It describes teh characteristics of data. In unit 5&#39;s context, understanding metadata is important for anaylyzing data and getting insight from it. By understanding metadata, we can learn how to manipulate and extract important data and draw conclusions about it, which is a major focus of unit 5. . Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? . Ipython provides a more flexible and interactive environment for working with pandas and images in jupyter notebooks. Ipython&#39;s tab completion allows to quickly view functions available to manipuate data. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? . Yes this code (grey scale code) looks like a series of steps. It looks like the functions such as management are depended on by other functions to run, and are all called at the very end of the code. . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? . First the function revieves an image object with a PIL object &#39;img&#39;. The function then recieves the data using img.getdata() and stores it in img_data. img_data is converted into a NumPy array. image[] --&gt; gray_data is a list created to store the grey scale values of the image. The function iterates through every pixel in image[]--&gt; data and calculates the average value of its RGB and stores the value in a variable called &#39;average&#39;. If the length of the pixel is greater than 3 the img is assumed to be PNG and its grey scale values are appended to the list along with the transparency values (alpha channel values). If it is not png only the grey scale values are appended. img.putdata method is used to update the image with the new grey scale values. The function then generates HTML for the grey scale image, stores it, and then displays. . Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? . In a scale image, colors are used to represent different data values. These colors can be manipulated causing &#39;filters&#39; such as grey scale, and red, green, blue scale. Thre three images go through the grey scale process and the outcome is a black and white version of the original photo. . Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? . Scale image is not a type of compression. It can be used as a precursor step to image compression but they are not the same. Image compression techniques can be used to compress color scale images though. . Incorporate into my project . I could not do this since my project does not incorporate images with actual function. . My Use of PIL . I started off by researching about other PIL effects, filters, and how to do color scales. . from IPython.display import Image, display from pathlib import Path # https://medium.com/@ageitgey/python-3-quick-tip-the-easy-way-to-deal-with-file-paths-on-windows-mac-and-linux-11a072b58d5f from PIL import ImageFilter import numpy as np # prepares a series of images def image_data(path=Path(&quot;images/&quot;), images=None): # path of static images is defaulted if images is None: # default image images = [ {&#39;source&#39;: &quot; World Flower database&quot;, &#39;label&#39;: &quot;Tulip&quot;, &#39;file&#39;: &quot;tulip.png&quot;} ] for image in images: # File to open image[&#39;filename&#39;] = path / image[&#39;file&#39;] # file with path return images def image_display(images): for image in images: display(Image(filename=image[&#39;filename&#39;])) # Large image scaled to baseWidth of 320 def scale_image(img): baseWidth = 320 scalePercent = (baseWidth/float(img.size[0])) scaleHeight = int((float(img.size[1])*float(scalePercent))) scale = (baseWidth, scaleHeight) return img.resize(scale) # PIL image converted to base64 def image_to_base64(img, format): with BytesIO() as buffer: img.save(buffer, format) return base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() # Set Properties of Image, Scale, and convert to Base64 def image_management(image): # path of static images is defaulted # Image open return PIL image object img = pilImage.open(image[&#39;filename&#39;]) # Python Image Library operations image[&#39;format&#39;] = img.format image[&#39;mode&#39;] = img.mode image[&#39;size&#39;] = img.size # Scale the Image img = scale_image(img) image[&#39;pil&#39;] = img image[&#39;scaled_size&#39;] = img.size # Scaled HTML image[&#39;html&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&#39;pil&#39;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # Create Grey Scale Base64 representation of Image def image_management_add_html_grey(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;gray_data&#39;] = [] # key/value for data converted to gray scale # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # create gray scale of image, ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-numpy-array-to-an-image/ average = (pixel[0] + pixel[1] + pixel[2]) // 3 # average pixel values and use // for integer division if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average, pixel[3])) # PNG format else: image[&#39;gray_data&#39;].append((average, average, average)) # end for loop for pixels img.putdata(image[&#39;gray_data&#39;]) image[&#39;html_grey&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) # Red Scale Base64 rep. of the image def image_management_add_html_red(image): # Image open return PIL image object img = image[&#39;pil&#39;] format = image[&#39;format&#39;] img_data = img.getdata() # Reference https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-pil-image-getdata/ image[&#39;data&#39;] = np.array(img_data) # PIL image to numpy array image[&#39;data_red&#39;] = [] # # data_red is a new list which will contain key-value pair of the converted red-scale data # &#39;data&#39; is a list of RGB data, the list is traversed and hex and binary lists are calculated and formatted for pixel in image[&#39;data&#39;]: # this will loop through every pixel (object) in the image data if len(pixel) &gt; 3: image[&#39;data_red&#39;].append((pixel[0], 0, 0, pixel[3])) # the zeroes are representing the blue and green being set to 0. this is in RGB format else: image[&#39;data_red&#39;].append((pixel[0], 0, 0)) img.putdata(image[&#39;data_red&#39;]) image[&#39;html_red&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(img, format) def image_management_add_html_blur(image): img = image[&#39;pil&#39;].filter(ImageFilter.BLUR) # updating image[] with the new blurred image # set new img pil_blur to original img image[&quot;pil_blur&quot;] = img image[&#39;html_blur&#39;] = &#39;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/png;base64,%s&quot;&gt;&#39; % image_to_base64(image[&quot;pil_blur&quot;], image[&#39;format&#39;]) # all image[html] store the manipulated, in this case blurred image into a string of base 64 (as stated above).

Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. .

COme up with three of your own beneficial and corresponding harmful effects of computing? Computers can help with different jobs, for example robot assisted surgery. A corresponding harm is that as jobs become more and more computerized, there may be a time where computer jobs surpass human labor. | Computers help spread information and can be used for education. A corresponding harm is that it can also spread misinformation and harmful bias, epecially to younger, more impressionable people. | Technology can help form communities of like-minded people. A corresponding harm is that technology can also drive wedges, and decrease the amount of face-to-face communication . | . | Talk about dopamine issues above? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? Social media, video games, and other forms of interactive technology have proved to become addicting by allowing our brains to release dopamine. This addiction is negative because it forces time away from things such as school and spending time with friends/family. This actually did affect me heavily to the point where I would have to sacrifice my own health and sleep in order to catch up on school work that I could‚Äôve done without the presence of my phone. Because of this I deleted social media off of my phone and since then, I have fixed the issue of my sleep schedule. I think this addiction is truly dangerous and affects many people at Del Norte. | . | 5.2 Digital Divide - Lesson Notes . Causes of digital divide: .

How does someone empower themself in a digital world? | Digital literacy allows for a plethora of things that lead to self empowerment. These things include self learning, self sustainability, access to more oppurtunities, and interest based skill development. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS? | | Empowered people can provide unempowered people by providing with a platform to empower themselves. Del Norte high school for example, provides many of their students with chromebooks. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there barriers like this at Del Norte? | | There are many barriers in our world that prevent the digital empowerment of certain people. One barrier at Del Norte is a financial barrier. Many aren‚Äôt able to be digitally empowered because they lack access to proper technology. | . 5.3 and 5.4 Notes . The hacks for this section are to summarize and give our takes on the discussion from class. . Algorithmic Bias . Computers can be biased in serveral ways: . Data (Discussed through training data of hp facial recognition software): data used to train a machine learning model can contain biases such as data sets that underepresent a certain group and therefore make unfair decisions about said groups. | Algorithms : Algorithms can be buil twith bias. Again, facial recognition software: darker skin tones yield higher fail rate for facial recognition software | Humans who designed algorithms, etc may be biased themselves (conspiracies we discussed in class) | . It is crucial to know and understand that technology can contain bias too and to consider that while writing your own algorithms. . Discussions: . Female AI voices: . We discussed that when designed, this AI may have had human basis or originate from stereotyping, we concluded that this voice was probably just a default that people just seemed to enjoy more. In an effort to meet peoples‚Äô expectations, they most likely just designed it that way. | . Are Hp computers racist: . I believe that Hp computers are not racist. For one, more data on people of color is required to make a conclusion. Secondly, it is clearly the training data that is faulty not the people neccesarliy selling the laptop. To avoid data bias we discussed the importance of crowd surfing through the use of online surveys. | . 5.4 Notes . Crowdsourcing: Using large, diverse, and quite random groups of people to get unbiased and pure data. In order to do this it is important to consider location, demographic, etc. | An excellent example of crowdsourcing we see in our class is through Rapid API. Some of that data, relating to surveys and people must have come from excellent crowd surfer | How could del norte help with crowdsources? we could ask people are our school to use our two main databases in order to give feedback about mainly the UI and to test if the program works with multipe people. We would have more perspective and therefore less bias so let‚Äôs begin the survey as son as possible. | . 5.5 and 5.6 Notes . 5.5 Notes . In the discussion we began by discussing the benefits and harms of copyright. We decided that the main harm is limitations when borrowing art or building off of it seen especially in youtube and the greatest benefit is allowing owners to be properly credited for their hard work. | We also talked about how unfair it is when creator‚Äôs get their work misused or ‚Äòstolen‚Äô. To avoid this, we use liscences (even on Github) to protect our work 5.5 Hacks Reflection . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . | Each license is unique in the needs they tend to and privacies they guarentee. After discussing, we came to the conclusion that the MIT license was the best because it allows versions of our original work to be used as long as we are credited. This is important because our project provides a framework for buisnesses such as cat cafes so allowing the public to use our project is essentially the entire purpose. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | As stated above, our group decided to use the MIT license since our website is meant to provide a framework for the public. | . 5.6 Notes . We began the discussion by talking about what happens when we google ourselves. Everybody mostly said that not much was on the internet about them because of our lack of presence on the internet and young age. | We discussed how certain information on the internet could be violating such as social security numbers, bank accounts, passwords, pictures. | We began to discuss the importance of internet safety and protecting sesitive information. We discussed things such as two factor authentification, encryption. | Lastly we discussed how we can prevent people, especially ones who do not use the internet as often from getting scammed or their private information stolen. The main vulnerable targets discussed were very old people and very young people, both not having much knowledge on internet safety. We talked about the importance of educating each other, using virus protectors, and not clicking on sketchy links. 5.6 Hacks Reflection . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . | Many of the project ask for names for a sign in. Additionally one of the projects asked for your grades which can be very personal to students. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? | I feel that my data when given to websites should be protected. I would not like it if my photos were out without my permission unless its something that I have given permission to post, such as school affiliated clubs and organizations. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. | Good passwords are unique to the person and do not contain ‚Äòeasy to guess‚Äô information like names and birth years. Another step used in authentication is two factor authentication, using your email or phone number which is good because it is less likely for someone to access your account that way. For example Slack uses two factor. I learned this the hard way because I used my school email to sign up and when it asked to email me I realized I couldn‚Äôt access an inbox thorugh my school email. (Still don‚Äôt know how to fix this) Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption | Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data. Assmmetric uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. | AES-256 is the technology we use to encrypt data in AWS Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. | My friend and I were researching for a research paper in English and one of the sites had some sketchy ads. My friend clicked on one by mistake and immediately it navigated to what seemed like a fake lottery site that asked for name, age and asked to provide card information to supposedly buy a lottery ticket. | Also I‚Äôve heard so many free-movie sites causing viruses horror stories from people | Additionally many scam callers have tried to get my credit card number on the most random occassions. Personally think it‚Äôs so out of pocket. | So one phishing technique, which usually works really well on old people is scam calls that promise one thing in exchange for your data. Another one is ‚Äòtoo good to be true‚Äô advertisements that steal your data like the fake lottery ticket site. | .",

I was able to finish this test in a shorter window of time, and I found that I could answer more questions without the help of outside resoureces. Here are notes on the four questions I got wrong. These questions fall under a category of questions that I found the most difficult. I will be discussing this, patterns I found, and strategies in the reflection portion of this blog. . Corrections . Here are the four problems that I answered incorrectly. There are other problems on the test that made me stop to think but those problems fall under the categories that these four problems address. . 27 . Which of the following code segments can be used to move the robot to the gray square along the path indicated by the arrows? My answer: The correct answer: N should be assigned a value one greater than n after the loops. Otherwise, the robot does not reach the right place since n is incremented incorrectly, given the initial assignment n=1. I think the reason that this problem stumped me is because the answer choices were so similar. Avoiding this mistake is simple, I would just have to read the choices more carefully and imagine the output of the code if it were to run. Writing down the results of each segment could be helpful. . 30 . The drawCircle procedure is to be used to draw the following figure on a coordinate grid. Which of the following code segments can be used to draw the figure My answer: x ‚Üê 4 y ‚Üê 1 r ‚Üê 0 REPEAT 3 TIMES { drawCircle(x, y, r) r ‚Üê r + 1 y ‚Üê y + 1 } The correct answer: x ‚Üê 4 y ‚Üê 1 r ‚Üê 0 REPEAT 3 TIMES { r ‚Üê r + 1 y ‚Üê y + 1 drawCircle(x, y, r) } This is correct because the r and y values must be incremented before the drawCircle method is called. This is very similar to the mistake I made on number 27. I think I need to work more on simulating the results of each code option in my head. . 32 . The figure below shows a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially facing upward. The robot can move into a white or gray square but cannot move into a black region. My answer: The correct answer: This answer is correct due to the middle block. ** Be more careful when reading code block answers. Try to draw them out. This is a little different from the previous two mistakes because this mistake does not involve increments. However, I think I just misread the answer choices because looking back, it is clear that 4-3 is the answer. . 39 . Programs I and II below are each intended to calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to n. Assume that n is a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶). Which of the following best describes the behavior of the two programs? My answer: Program II displays the correct sum, but program I does not. The correct answer: Both program I and program II display the correct sum. I thought the first one did not work. However it does work and this mistake could have been avoided if I took note of how the variable result was affected through the loops. . Hexa to Decimal . to convert hexadecimal, take each digit of the hexadecimal from right to left and multiply by powers of 16 starting from 0 and replace the digits. | . Reflection . Overall, most of these mistakes I had could be avoided through drawing out the results or writing down my thoughts. It will be importnt that I learn where the increments should go within the loops. Also it was mentioned above in questions but I had to search up how to convert hexa decimal to decimal. . Heuristic: not every problem can be solved with code without sacrificing perfection for the sake of simplicity and time | Make sure to check every single option | For problems with multiple selections, make sure to look at each very carefully | .",

The program allows the user to input their name, written review, and numerical rating of their experience. The user data is validated and then added to a database and displayed in a well organized table for future users to view. Additionally, the program updates the average rate value with every new review added and gives authorized users to delete certain reviews. . . . Managing Complexities The list being used here is ratesList. ratesList is used to store an array of the rates taken from each user‚Äôs review in the database. This ratesList is used in two ways. For one, it is averaged to provide for the average rate, which updates for every review added. Additionally, ratesList is used in creating the rates distribution table. For this task each rate must be accounted for, checked, and then assigned to its proper distribution value. To do this task with variables or another method would be inefficient and time consuming as the number of rates in the database increases. A list also maintains the necessary information in one location making it easier to access and keep track of for operations. In ratesList is a change were to be made, such as a change in the number of rates, an additional object in the list would be created rather than a new variable. . . Procedural Abstraction This procedure countRates() takes a list as a parameter. First the variables ratevalue_1, ratevalue_2 ‚Ä¶. ratevalue_5 are assigned to the value 0. The function will count the number of each rate value present in the list and add it to the counter variables to return a dictionary of key-value pairs containing the counted rates data. . . Algorithmic Implementation The program iterates through the list defined in the parameters beginning with a for statement, stating to iterate through all values in the list within the length of the list. The program then uses if/elif statements to see if the value being passed matches the certain parameter, and therefore what ratevalue_num counter variable should be updated accordingly. The loop repeats for the length of the list, therefore accounting for every rate in the database. The function will count the number of each rate value present in the list and add it to the counter variables to return a sequenced dictionary of key-value pairs containing the counted rates data. . Testing Condition(s) tested by the first call: This call will include an unhappy review, with a rate of 1. Condition(s) tested by the first call: This call will include an happy review, with a rate of 5. Result(s) tested by the first call: The average rate will decrease due to an addition of a rate lesser than the original average. The rate will be appended to ratesList, and an increase of one will be accounted for in ratevalue_1 and displayed in the reviews distribution table . Result(s) tested by the first call: The average rate will increase due to an addition of a rate greater than the original average. The rate will be appended to ratesList, and an increase of one will be accounted for in ratevalue_5 and displayed in the reviews distribution table. .",

One major discrpancy is college board&#39;s standards when they ask for a specific explanation. For example, a procedure shoudl be explained so clearly that one could redo it. A lack of detail in the explanations can cause a loss of full points for any section. Also in testing, the program must be tested and must display two different corresponding inputs and outputs. I will ensure to take careful consideration of these things and especially pay attention to details when writing my own descriptions. .",

Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: Functions and methods . Why are procedures effective?: Convenient to change errors, ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Additional Notes . procedures are functions | procedures simplify programs | procedures split tasks into individual components that need to be done | procedures have parameters (what the procedure is going to work on/convert/etc) | seperating program to procedures in order to simplify it is called modularity | . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . num = 7 def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num # Driver Code convert(num) . 0111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . findMax = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&gt;numberB) { max = numberA; } else { max = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The max is &quot; + max); }; findMin = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&lt;numberB) { min = numberA; } else { min = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The min is &quot; + min); }; findMax(2,3) findMin(6,10) . The max is 3 The min is 6 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num def wordtobin(word): word = str(word) list = [] for letter in word: list.append(letter) for item in list: index = list.index(item) new = ord(item) list[index] = new for i in list: z = list.index(i) new = convert(i) list[int(z)] = new word = input(&quot;What word would you like to convert to binary?&quot;) print(word, &quot; to binary is:&quot;) wordtobin(word) .

Unit 3.14 Libraries Lesson . Here is our lesson about libraries! . Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | Extra Notes . libraries need to be installed or imported before being used | Packages allow user to import methos from a library | Libraries come with documentation (like a guide to their syntax) | . import random as rd print(rd.randint(1,5)) from random import randint randint(1,5) from random import randint as ri ri(1,5) from random import * print(randint(1,5)) . 3 2 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python __ library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() import turtle turtle.bgcolor(&#39;light blue&#39;) turtle.speed(2) for i in range(20): turtle.circle(3*i) turtle.circle(-3*i) turtle.left(i) . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | _input decimal number, returns the next highest integer__ | . floor(x)_ | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial_ | . gcd(x,y)_ | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y, cant be decimals | . lcm(x,y) | returns least common multiple | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * x = input(&quot;Insert your first number:&quot;) y = input(&quot;Insert your second number:&quot;) xfloat = floor(float(x)) yfloat = floor(float(y)) xceil = ceil(float(x)) yceil = ceil(float(y)) gcdv = gcd(xfloat, yfloat) xfac = factorial(xfloat) yfac = factorial(yfloat) print(&#39;Each number rounded down:&#39;, xfloat ,&quot; and &quot;, yfloat) print(&#39;Each number rounded up:&#39;, xceil ,&quot; and &quot;, yceil) print(&#39;GCD:&#39;, gcdv) print(&#39;Each numbers factorial :&#39;, xfac ,&quot; and &quot;, yfac) . Each number rounded down: 2 and 7 Each number rounded up: 3 and 8 GCD: 1 Each numbers factorial : 2 and 5040 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . import turtle import random turtle.bgcolor(&#39;light blue&#39;) x = random.randint(3,10) print(x) length = 15 for i in range(x): turtle.forward(length) turtle.right(360/x) turtle.forward(length) .",

            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the next power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) . Index: False . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. .

Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . def sqrt_trial(N): numlist = [] num = 0 lo = 0 while num &lt;= N: numlist.append(num) num = num + 1 else: hi = num mid = (lo + hi) / 2 for mid in numlist: if mid**2 == N: return mid elif mid**2 &lt; N: hi = mid mid = (hi-lo)/2 elif mid**2 &gt; N: lo = mid mid = (hi-lo)/2 sqrt_trial(169) . 13 . The fucntion sqrt trial worked, but It will not work with higher numbers since it will have to search through a longer list.

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 .

Computing innovation: integrates the use of a program in order to function | Collaboration is necessary in order to avoid bias, and have new perspectives in development. This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3 | Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building | Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors | Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group | You can collaborate using repl, github, shared doc, comments in code | . 1.2 Program Function and Purpose . All computing innovations are developed for a purpose and this purpose guides the development of the program | Computer programs take inputs in a variety of fashions to influence the program‚Äôs behavior | Computer programs: collection of statements that are executed according to the rules of the programming language Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . | Input: Artist Name and Album | Output: Album duration, album song names, number of songs, album cover photo The purpose of this program is to provide users with data about their favorite artists including their albums, songs, and album duration and allow them to choose their favorite artists. | . 1.3 Program Design and Development . Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose | Programs are developed by groups of people and new prgrams are often written by expaning on the programs already written by others | Programmers can use comments/ documentation (short descriptions) to explain the purpose of their program to themselves, collaboraters, and others involved Row 2: Data Abstraction . Data about song and artists stored in dictionary which is retrieved using API . | . Row 3: Managing Complexity . use a function to read user input and only provide wanted album information allowing user to use favorites tab to organize the artists they enjoy . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . using artist[album], retrieve only wanted data from the dictionary. call developed function to run based on user input. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . develop algorithim to count number of songs in album given API data algorithm to create ‚Äòfavorite artists‚Äô tab, where users - can select their favorite artists to be saved in a seperate section of the application . Row 6: Testing . Input multiple artists and album. See if each selected data type displays proper data. Add artists to ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô and see if that data is stored . 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors . Errors are inevitable, they happen | Understanding the different types of errors is important to being a proficient programmer | To understand errors, programmers need to create testing schemes to ensure programs are working as intented Identifying and Correcting Errors practice | .",

We recieved alot of feedback and features that we could have added. It is important to present your project and hear from multiple users and gain perspective to create a product that is universal and lacks bias. . Seeing Other‚Äôs Projects . Seeing other people‚Äôs projects was just as good of an experience. Peoples ideas and passions really shone through. Visually many projects were satisfying to look at and many had user interaction.

Overall Night of the Museum was a really helpful learning experience. Getting user feedback and gaining inspiration are all part of the process of creating a successful final product. In the future, I now know that utilizing user feedback into my decisions while creating products is important.

AppLab Creation | Personality Quiz . | Program Purpose This purpose of this program is to test the user‚Äôs ability to recognize popular luxury brand logos. | Program Functionality This program consists of three questions in order to quiz the user on their ability to recognize logos. It starts at the home page and navigates through each question page. If the answer selected is wrong, the program leads the user to an ‚Äòincorrect‚Äô question that allows the user to either retry the question or get a hint. The last screen desplays the results of the quiz. | Program Testing I tested this program multiple times. At first I did not use hints and realized that for someone without knowledge of brands, not having hints or retries could be discouraging. Also, the score calculator was not displaying because the if statement was not under an ‚Äòon event statement‚Äô. After changing this and reassigning score values to each answer I got better results. App Planning - Logos Quiz . | Home page (introduces quiz, leads to q1) | Q1: question with four options A B C D. If correct answer isn‚Äôt chosen, lead user to ‚Äòincorrect‚Äô page. Incorrect page displays that the user input was incorrect and has option to return to the question or recieve a hint. When correct answer choice is clicked, leads to ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô page which leads to question 2. | Q2: choose between four image options using check box. If correct answer isn‚Äôt checked, lead user to ‚Äòincorrect‚Äô page. Incorrect page displays that the user input was incorrect and has option to return to the question or recieve a hint. When correct answer choice is clicked, leads to ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô page which leads to question 2. | Q3: choose between two images. If incorrect, lead to incorrect page and option to return to question | . Additions . Successes: use of correct/incorrect pages, check boxs | Failures: tried to use a for loop but wasn‚Äôt able to because when looped the incorrect answers had to go to different pages based on the question that was incorrect, drop down failed because dropdown only changed the screen and did not give an output | Adjustments: could not use the dropdown so I used the checkbozes instead. Loops did not work due to the fact that each user input needed specific screen changes. So I did not use loops. Ideally I would have figured out the loops because the code was very long. | . Extra . created a second quiz inspired by buzzfeed quix | created a series of questions that determine whether you are an introvert or extrovert | I created a variable ‚Äòscore‚Äô and for whichever answer I added/subtracted it a specific value to be added to var score. | In the end I used an if/else statement and said that if score was greater than 0, to display the score and ‚Äòintrovert‚Äô | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
