Our was about music which is something we were passionate about and others were as well. Our project had interactive elements but may have been too personal. We recieved alot of feedback and features that we could have added. It is important to present your project and hear from multiple users and gain perspective to create a product that is universal and lacks bias! . Seeing Other’s Projects . Seeing other people’s projects was just as good of an experience. Peoples ideas and passions really shone through. Visually many projects were satisfying to look at and many had user interaction. But most importantly, seeing other’s ideas gave us ideas for improvement in our own project. Getting inspiration from others is always helpful. . Final Reflection . Overall Night of the Museum was a really helpful learning experience. Getting user feedback and gaining inspiration are all part of the process of creating a successful final product. In the future, I now know that utilizing user feedback into my decisions while creating products is important. Overall I have learned so much in this class, not only coding related, but also collaboration, and persistance. I can’t wait for what’s to come in Tri 2. Thank you Mr. Mort!! .",

This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3 | Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building | Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors | Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group | You can collaborate using repl, github, shared doc, comments in code | . 1.2 Program Function and Purpose . All computing innovations are developed for a purpose and this purpose guides the development of the program | Computer programs take inputs in a variety of fashions to influence the program’s behavior | Computer programs: collection of statements that are executed according to the rules of the programming language Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . | Input: Artist Name and Album | Output: Album duration, album song names, number of songs, album cover photo The purpose of this program is to provide users with data about their favorite artists including their albums, songs, and album duration and allow them to choose their favorite artists. | . 1.3 Program Design and Development . Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose | Programs are developed by groups of people and new prgrams are often written by expaning on the programs already written by others | Programmers can use comments/ documentation (short descriptions) to explain the purpose of their program to themselves, collaboraters, and others involved Row 2: Data Abstraction . Data about song and artists stored in dictionary which is retrieved using API . | . Row 3: Managing Complexity . use a function to read user input and only provide wanted album information allowing user to use favorites tab to organize the artists they enjoy . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . using artist[album], retrieve only wanted data from the dictionary. call developed function to run based on user input. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . develop algorithim to count number of songs in album given API data algorithm to create ‘favorite artists’ tab, where users - can select their favorite artists to be saved in a seperate section of the application . Row 6: Testing . Input multiple artists and album. See if each selected data type displays proper data. Add artists to ‘favorites’ and see if that data is stored . 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors . Errors are inevitable, they happen | Understanding the different types of errors is important to being a proficient programmer | To understand errors, programmers need to create testing schemes to ensure programs are working as intented Identifying and Correcting Errors practice | .",

Our was about music which is something we were passionate about and others were as well. Our project had interactive elements but may have been too personal. We recieved alot of feedback and features that we could have added. It is important to present your project and hear from multiple users and gain perspective to create a product that is universal and lacks bias. . Seeing Other’s Projects . Seeing other people’s projects was just as good of an experience. Peoples ideas and passions really shone through. Visually many projects were satisfying to look at and many had user interaction. But most importantly, seeing other’s ideas gave us ideas for improvement in our own project. Getting inspiration from others is always helpful. . Final Reflection . Overall Night of the Museum was a really helpful learning experience. Getting user feedback and gaining inspiration are all part of the process of creating a successful final product. In the future, I now know that utilizing user feedback into my decisions while creating products is important. Overall I have learned so much in this class, not only coding related, but also collaboration, and persistance. I can’t wait for what’s to come in Tri 2. Thank you Mr. Mort!! .",

            "content": "Creative Development Blog . AppLab Creations . AppLab Creation | Personality Quiz . | Program Purpose This purpose of this program is to test the user’s ability to recognize popular luxury brand logos. | Program Functionality This program consists of three questions in order to quiz the user on their ability to recognize logos. It starts at the home page and navigates through each question page. If the answer selected is wrong, the program leads the user to an ‘incorrect’ question that allows the user to either retry the question or get a hint. The last screen desplays the results of the quiz. | Program Testing I tested this program multiple times. At first I did not use hints and realized that for someone without knowledge of brands, not having hints or retries could be discouraging. Also, the score calculator was not displaying because the if statement was not under an ‘on event statement’. After changing this and reassigning score values to each answer I got better results. App Planning - Logos Quiz . | Home page (introduces quiz, leads to q1) | Q1: question with four options A B C D. If correct answer isn’t chosen, lead user to ‘incorrect’ page. Incorrect page displays that the user input was incorrect and has option to return to the question or recieve a hint. When correct answer choice is clicked, leads to ‘correct’ page which leads to question 2. | Q2: choose between four image options using check box. If correct answer isn’t checked, lead user to ‘incorrect’ page. Incorrect page displays that the user input was incorrect and has option to return to the question or recieve a hint. When correct answer choice is clicked, leads to ‘correct’ page which leads to question 2. | Q3: choose between two images. If incorrect, lead to incorrect page and option to return to question | . Additions . Successes: use of correct/incorrect pages, check boxs | Failures: tried to use a for loop but wasn’t able to because when looped the incorrect answers had to go to different pages based on the question that was incorrect, drop down failed because dropdown only changed the screen and did not give an output | Adjustments: could not use the dropdown so I used the checkbozes instead. Loops did not work due to the fact that each user input needed specific screen changes. So I did not use loops. Ideally I would have figured out the loops because the code was very long. | . Extra . created a second quiz inspired by buzzfeed quix | created a series of questions that determine whether you are an introvert or extrovert | I created a variable ‘score’ and for whichever answer I added/subtracted it a specific value to be added to var score. | In the end I used an if/else statement and said that if score was greater than 0, to display the score and ‘introvert’ | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
