Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: Functions and methods . Why are procedures effective?: Convenient to change errors, ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Additional Notes . procedures are functions | procedures simplify programs | procedures split tasks into individual components that need to be done | procedures have parameters (what the procedure is going to work on/convert/etc) | seperating program to procedures in order to simplify it is called modularity | . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . num = 7 def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num # Driver Code convert(num) . 0111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . findMax = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&gt;numberB) { max = numberA; } else { max = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The max is &quot; + max); }; findMin = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&lt;numberB) { min = numberA; } else { min = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The min is &quot; + min); }; findMax(2,3) findMin(6,10) . The max is 3 The min is 6 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num def wordtobin(word): word = str(word) list = [] for letter in word: list.append(letter) for item in list: index = list.index(item) new = ord(item) list[index] = new for i in list: z = list.index(i) new = convert(i) list[int(z)] = new word = input(&quot;What word would you like to convert to binary?&quot;) print(word, &quot; to binary is:&quot;) wordtobin(word) .

            "content": "Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about _functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods__ from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with __ on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick _google search__. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the __ methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called __. We will learn different ways to __ in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single ___ from the package. We can do that with the word , followed by the package name, then the word _, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use ___. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word __, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import random as rd print(rd.randint(1,5)) from random import randint randint(1,5) from random import randint as ri ri(1,5) from random import * print(randint(1,5)) . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python __ library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | _input decimal number, returns the next highest integer__ | . floor(x)_ | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial_ | . gcd(x,y)_ | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y, cant be decimals | . lcm(x,y) | returns least common multiple | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * x = input(&quot;Insert your first number:&quot;) y = input(&quot;Insert your second number:&quot;) xfloat = floor(float(x)) yfloat = floor(float(y)) xceil = ceil(float(x)) yceil = ceil(float(y)) gcdv = gcd(xfloat, yfloat) xfac = factorial(xfloat) yfac = factorial(yfloat) print(&#39;Each number rounded down:&#39;, xfloat ,&quot; and &quot;, yfloat) print(&#39;Each number rounded up:&#39;, xceil ,&quot; and &quot;, yceil) print(&#39;GCD:&#39;, gcdv) print(&#39;Each numbers factorial :&#39;, xfac ,&quot; and &quot;, yfac) . Each number rounded down: 6 and 3 Each number rounded up: 7 and 4 GCD: 3 Each numbers factorial : 720 and 6 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! .",

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the next power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . def sqrt_trial(N): numlist = [] num = 0 lo = 0 while num &lt;= N: numlist.append(num) num = num + 1 else: hi = num mid = (lo + hi) / 2 for mid in numlist: if mid**2 == N: return mid elif mid**2 &lt; N: hi = mid mid = (hi-lo)/2 elif mid**2 &gt; N: lo = mid mid = (hi-lo)/2 sqrt_trial(169) . 13 . The fucntion sqrt trial worked, but It will not work with higher numbers since it will have to search through a longer list. It was a good start but because of this I had to find a way to do binary search without using a list . def sqrt(N): hi = N lo = 0 if N &gt; 1: hi = N // 2 while hi &gt;= lo: mid = (lo + hi) // 2 if (mid**2) == N: return mid elif (mid**2) &lt; N: lo = mid + 1 else: hi = mid - 1 return None print(sqrt(169)) . 13 . from math import sqrt as sq test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): for i in range(len(test_cases)): if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) checkValid() .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 .

Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 for i in range(10): if i % 2 == 1: sum = sum + i print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture.

Our was about music which is something we were passionate about and others were as well. Our project had interactive elements but may have been too personal. We recieved alot of feedback and features that we could have added. It is important to present your project and hear from multiple users and gain perspective to create a product that is universal and lacks bias! . Seeing Other’s Projects . Seeing other people’s projects was just as good of an experience. Peoples ideas and passions really shone through. Visually many projects were satisfying to look at and many had user interaction. But most importantly, seeing other’s ideas gave us ideas for improvement in our own project. Getting inspiration from others is always helpful. . Final Reflection . Overall Night of the Museum was a really helpful learning experience. Getting user feedback and gaining inspiration are all part of the process of creating a successful final product. In the future, I now know that utilizing user feedback into my decisions while creating products is important. Overall I have learned so much in this class, not only coding related, but also collaboration, and persistance. I can’t wait for what’s to come in Tri 2. Thank you Mr. Mort!! .",

Both J and K need to be between 1 and the length of numList (inclusive). The code makes a copy of numList and names it newList. Then the element at newList(j) is switched and instead assigned the element at numList(k).

Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose | Programs are developed by groups of people and new prgrams are often written by expaning on the programs already written by others | Programmers can use comments/ documentation (short descriptions) to explain the purpose of their program to themselves, collaboraters, and others involved Row 2: Data Abstraction .

Row 3: Managing Complexity . use a function to read user input and only provide wanted album information allowing user to use favorites tab to organize the artists they enjoy . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . using artist[album], retrieve only wanted data from the dictionary. call developed function to run based on user input. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . develop algorithim to count number of songs in album given API data algorithm to create ‘favorite artists’ tab, where users - can select their favorite artists to be saved in a seperate section of the application . Row 6: Testing . Input multiple artists and album. See if each selected data type displays proper data. Add artists to ‘favorites’ and see if that data is stored . 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors .

Successes: use of correct/incorrect pages, check boxs | Failures: tried to use a for loop but wasn’t able to because when looped the incorrect answers had to go to different pages based on the question that was incorrect, drop down failed because dropdown only changed the screen and did not give an output | Adjustments: could not use the dropdown so I used the checkbozes instead. Loops did not work due to the fact that each user input needed specific screen changes. So I did not use loops. Ideally I would have figured out the loops because the code was very long. | . Extra . created a second quiz inspired by buzzfeed quix | created a series of questions that determine whether you are an introvert or extrovert | I created a variable ‘score’ and for whichever answer I added/subtracted it a specific value to be added to var score. | In the end I used an if/else statement and said that if score was greater than 0, to display the score and ‘introvert’ | .",

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
