Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. . Parameters: input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks . Procedural Abstraction: provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: Functions and methods . Why are procedures effective?: Convenient to change errors, ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program . Additional Notes . procedures are functions | procedures simplify programs | procedures split tasks into individual components that need to be done | procedures have parameters (what the procedure is going to work on/convert/etc) | seperating program to procedures in order to simplify it is called modularity | . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . num = 7 def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num # Driver Code convert(num) . 0111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . findMax = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&gt;numberB) { max = numberA; } else { max = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The max is &quot; + max); }; findMin = function(numberA, numberB){ if (numberA&lt;numberB) { min = numberA; } else { min = numberB; } console.log(&quot;The min is &quot; + min); }; findMax(2,3) findMin(6,10) . The max is 3 The min is 6 . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num def wordtobin(word): word = str(word) list = [] for letter in word: list.append(letter) for item in list: index = list.index(item) new = ord(item) list[index] = new for i in list: z = list.index(i) new = convert(i) list[int(z)] = new word = input(&quot;What word would you like to convert to binary?&quot;) print(word, &quot; to binary is:&quot;) wordtobin(word) . APCSP to binary is: 0100000101010000010000110101001101010000 . word = &quot;APCSP&quot; conversion = &#39;-&#39;.join(format(ord(x), &#39;b&#39;) for x in word) print(word , &quot;to binary is:&quot; , conversion) . APCSP to binary is: 1000001-1010000-1000011-1010011-1010000 .

Machines have fostered progress and creativity in medical field, engineering, communications, and even art However computing innovations can also have downsides: | digital divide | bias | legal/ethical concerns | internet safety | Dopamine | Additionally you could have loss of privacy, replacement of humans for jobs, over dependence on technology, and negative health consequences. | Example: AI, machine learning, and data mining have greatly benefitted many fields, but also cause bias and unintended discrimination To be a responsible programmer, it is important to look at the bigger picture, and understand the effects of any computing innovation they create. | . 5.1 Blog Reflection Questions . COme up with three of your own beneficial and corresponding harmful effects of computing? Computers can help with different jobs, for example robot assisted surgery. A corresponding harm is that as jobs become more and more computerized, there may be a time where computer jobs surpass human labor. | Computers help spread information and can be used for education. A corresponding harm is that it can also spread misinformation and harmful bias, epecially to younger, more impressionable people. | Technology can help form communities of like-minded people. A corresponding harm is that technology can also drive wedges, and decrease the amount of face-to-face communication . | . | Talk about dopamine issues above? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? Social media, video games, and other forms of interactive technology have proved to become addicting by allowing our brains to release dopamine. This addiction is negative because it forces time away from things such as school and spending time with friends/family. This actually did affect me heavily to the point where I would have to sacrifice my own health and sleep in order to catch up on school work that I could’ve done without the presence of my phone. Because of this I deleted social media off of my phone and since then, I have fixed the issue of my sleep schedule. I think this addiction is truly dangerous and affects many people at Del Norte. | . | 5.2 Digital Divide - Lesson Notes . Causes of digital divide: . Digital divide: the gulf between those who have ready access to computers and the internet and those who do not. As technology evoloves the digital divide presents equal participation and oppurtunity in all parts of life, affecting people in certain countries, and households with low income. | Poor or rural areas in the world have less access to technology | Also some countries have restricted access At Del Norte: | Internet blockers | Need for personal computers | Internet safety | . 5.2 Blog Reflection Questions . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? | Digital literacy allows for a plethora of things that lead to self empowerment. These things include self learning, self sustainability, access to more oppurtunities, and interest based skill development. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS? | | Empowered people can provide unempowered people by providing with a platform to empower themselves. Del Norte high school for example, provides many of their students with chromebooks. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there barriers like this at Del Norte? | | There are many barriers in our world that prevent the digital empowerment of certain people. One barrier at Del Norte is a financial barrier. Many aren’t able to be digitally empowered because they lack access to proper technology. | . 5.3 and 5.4 Notes . The hacks for this section are to summarize and give our takes on the discussion from class. . Algorithmic Bias . Computers can be biased in serveral ways: . Data (Discussed through training data of hp facial recognition software): data used to train a machine learning model can contain biases such as data sets that underepresent a certain group and therefore make unfair decisions about said groups. | Algorithms : Algorithms can be buil twith bias. Again, facial recognition software: darker skin tones yield higher fail rate for facial recognition software | Humans who designed algorithms, etc may be biased themselves (conspiracies we discussed in class) | . It is crucial to know and understand that technology can contain bias too and to consider that while writing your own algorithms. . Discussions: . Female AI voices: . We discussed that when designed, this AI may have had human basis or originate from stereotyping, we concluded that this voice was probably just a default that people just seemed to enjoy more. In an effort to meet peoples’ expectations, they most likely just designed it that way. | . Are Hp computers racist: . I believe that Hp computers are not racist. For one, more data on people of color is required to make a conclusion. Secondly, it is clearly the training data that is faulty not the people neccesarliy selling the laptop. To avoid data bias we discussed the importance of crowd surfing through the use of online surveys. | . 5.4 Notes . Crowdsourcing: Using large, diverse, and quite random groups of people to get unbiased and pure data. In order to do this it is important to consider location, demographic, etc. | An excellent example of crowdsourcing we see in our class is through Rapid API. Some of that data, relating to surveys and people must have come from excellent crowd surfer | How could del norte help with crowdsources? we could ask people are our school to use our two main databases in order to give feedback about mainly the UI and to test if the program works with multipe people. We would have more perspective and therefore less bias so let’s begin the survey as son as possible. | . 5.5 and 5.6 Notes . 5.5 Notes . In the discussion we began by discussing the benefits and harms of copyright. We decided that the main harm is limitations when borrowing art or building off of it seen especially in youtube and the greatest benefit is allowing owners to be properly credited for their hard work. | We also talked about how unfair it is when creator’s get their work misused or ‘stolen’. To avoid this, we use liscences (even on Github) to protect our work 5.5 Hacks Reflection . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . | Each license is unique in the needs they tend to and privacies they guarentee. After discussing, we came to the conclusion that the MIT license was the best because it allows versions of our original work to be used as long as we are credited. This is important because our project provides a framework for buisnesses such as cat cafes so allowing the public to use our project is essentially the entire purpose. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. (restated) | In the discussion we began by discussing the benefits and harms of copyright. We decided that the main harm is limitations when borrowing art or building off of it seen especially in youtube and the greatest benefit is allowing owners to be properly credited for their hard work. | We also talked about how unfair it is when creator’s get their work misused or ‘stolen’. To avoid this, we use liscences (even on Github) to protect our work Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | As stated above, our group decided to use the MIT license since our website is meant to provide a framework for the public. | . 5.6 Notes . We began the discussion by talking about what happens when we google ourselves. Everybody mostly said that not much was on the internet about them because of our lack of presence on the internet and young age. | We discussed how certain information on the internet could be violating such as social security numbers, bank accounts, passwords, pictures. | We began to discuss the importance of internet safety and protecting sesitive information. We discussed things such as two factor authentification, encryption. | Lastly we discussed how we can prevent people, especially ones who do not use the internet as often from getting scammed or their private information stolen. The main vulnerable targets discussed were very old people and very young people, both not having much knowledge on internet safety. We talked about the importance of educating each other, using virus protectors, and not clicking on sketchy links. 5.6 Hacks Reflection . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . | Many of the project ask for names for a sign in. Additionally one of the projects asked for your grades which can be very personal to students. What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? | I feel that my data when given to websites should be protected. I would not like it if my photos were out without my permission unless its something that I have given permission to post, such as school affiliated clubs and organizations. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. | Good passwords are unique to the person and do not contain ‘easy to guess’ information like names and birth years. Another step used in authentication is two factor authentication, using your email or phone number which is good because it is less likely for someone to access your account that way. For example Slack uses two factor. I learned this the hard way because I used my school email to sign up and when it asked to email me I realized I couldn’t access an inbox thorugh my school email. (Still don’t know how to fix this) Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption | Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data. Assmmetric uses two different keys to encrypt and decrypt. Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. | AES-256 is the technology we use to encrypt data in AWS Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. | My friend and I were researching for a research paper in English and one of the sites had some sketchy ads. My friend clicked on one by mistake and immediately it navigated to what seemed like a fake lottery site that asked for name, age and asked to provide card information to supposedly buy a lottery ticket. | Also I’ve heard so many free-movie sites causing viruses horror stories from people | Additionally many scam callers have tried to get my credit card number on the most random occassions. Personally think it’s so out of pocket. | So one phishing technique, which usually works really well on old people is scam calls that promise one thing in exchange for your data. Another one is ‘too good to be true’ advertisements that steal your data like the fake lottery ticket site. | .",

            "content": "Results . Overall, I did better on this test compared to the last. I was able to finish this test in a shorter window of time, and I found that I could answer more questions without the help of outside resoureces. Here are notes on the four questions I got wrong. These questions fall under a category of questions that I found the most difficult. I will be discussing this, patterns I found, and strategies in the reflection portion of this blog. . Corrections . Here are the four problems that I answered incorrectly. There are other problems on the test that made me stop to think but those problems fall under the categories that these four problems address. . 27 . Which of the following code segments can be used to move the robot to the gray square along the path indicated by the arrows? My answer: The correct answer: N should be assigned a value one greater than n after the loops. Otherwise, the robot does not reach the right place since n is incremented incorrectly, given the initial assignment n=1. I think the reason that this problem stumped me is because the answer choices were so similar. Avoiding this mistake is simple, I would just have to read the choices more carefully and imagine the output of the code if it were to run. Writing down the results of each segment could be helpful. . 30 . The drawCircle procedure is to be used to draw the following figure on a coordinate grid. Which of the following code segments can be used to draw the figure My answer: x ← 4 y ← 1 r ← 0 REPEAT 3 TIMES { drawCircle(x, y, r) r ← r + 1 y ← y + 1 } The correct answer: x ← 4 y ← 1 r ← 0 REPEAT 3 TIMES { r ← r + 1 y ← y + 1 drawCircle(x, y, r) } This is correct because the r and y values must be incremented before the drawCircle method is called. This is very similar to the mistake I made on number 27. I think I need to work more on simulating the results of each code option in my head. . 32 . The figure below shows a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially facing upward. The robot can move into a white or gray square but cannot move into a black region. My answer: The correct answer: This answer is correct due to the middle block. ** Be more careful when reading code block answers. Try to draw them out. This is a little different from the previous two mistakes because this mistake does not involve increments. However, I think I just misread the answer choices because looking back, it is clear that 4-3 is the answer. . 39 . Programs I and II below are each intended to calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to n. Assume that n is a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …). Which of the following best describes the behavior of the two programs? My answer: Program II displays the correct sum, but program I does not. The correct answer: Both program I and program II display the correct sum. I thought the first one did not work. However it does work and this mistake could have been avoided if I took note of how the variable result was affected through the loops. . Hexa to Decimal . to convert hexadecimal, take each digit of the hexadecimal from right to left and multiply by powers of 16 starting from 0 and replace the digits. | . Reflection . Overall, most of these mistakes I had could be avoided through drawing out the results or writing down my thoughts. It will be importnt that I learn where the increments should go within the loops. Also it was mentioned above in questions but I had to search up how to convert hexa decimal to decimal. . Heuristic: not every problem can be solved with code without sacrificing perfection for the sake of simplicity and time | Make sure to check every single option | For problems with multiple selections, make sure to look at each very carefully | .",

            "content": "Overview . My part in Cafe Gato (an online template for a hypothetical cat cafe), is a reviews page. A user can utilize the frontend endpoint to submit their rating and written review about their experience at Cafe Gato, along with seeing other’s reviews, including a display of the average rating. . Purpose and Function . The purpose is to provide customers a place to leave their honest reviews of the cafe, potential customers to view past reccomendations and finally for the buisness to review its performance by customer opinion. . ​Function: ​There is a frontend endpoint with input boxes to input stars, name, and review. A backend will then record this data, if validated and then be added to the reviews database. On the frontend, users can view all reviews along with a calculated average rating. . Data Abstraction . When JSON data of all the reviews is parsed, then a list, maybe called ratingsList , will record all of the rates. List will be iterated through to decide how many of each rate was recorded, and list’s content will be averaged to decide average. . Managing Complexity . Using the ratingList is managing complexity because it allows for the program to easily sort through it, using iteration in order to record the individual amount of people who opted for each rate. . Procedural Abstraction . A procedure, probably named something like sortRates() , would iterate through the list in order to decide how many people correspond to each number rating. This way, the data can be displayed on the user frontend. . Algorithm Implementation . Sequencing will be used in order for the reviews to be organized from highest rate at the top to lowest at the bottom. This is important because the user should see the best ratings first for a good impression . Selection will be incorporated when the next most recent rate is found and appended to the ratingList. Iteration is used when looking through the list to organize and count the elements by rate value. . Testing . My two tests would be with a review of the ratings: . 5: Reviews db will be updated, and should be displayed at the very top of the list. | 1: Reviews db will be updated, and should be displayed at the very bottom of the list. | Video Plan . I will show the input of a review of rating 5, reload the page and show its appearance at the top of the frontend. Then I will do the same with rating 1, and show its appearance at the bottom of the page. I would also like to show how the average rating shown at the top of the screen also changes. (increases with the addition of 5 and decreases with addition of 1) .",

Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Explains how adding fish or changing the program requires minimum effort withh a list rather than having to create a whole new variable. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | clone movement has fie parameters and is called successfully. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Includes sequencing, iteration, and selection | . Testing | 0 | 0 | Testing response doesn&#39;t really test different input from the program, but rather tests condtions like the game mode and amount of fish . The conditions are what should be varied to give different outputs in the two calls. | . Reflection 3 . Overall my scores were very similar to the college board scores. One major discrpancy is college board&#39;s standards when they ask for a specific explanation. For example, a procedure shoudl be explained so clearly that one could redo it. A lack of detail in the explanations can cause a loss of full points for any section. Also in testing, the program must be tested and must display two different corresponding inputs and outputs. I will ensure to take careful consideration of these things and especially pay attention to details when writing my own descriptions. .",

How to import random to python | How to use random with a list or number range | How to code randomness in everyday scenarios | . ADD YOUR ADDITIONAL NOTES HERE: . What are Random Values? . Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring . Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result . What are Examples of Random outputs in the world? Add a few you can think of. . Ex: Marbles | . Why do we need Random Values for code? . Random values can be used in coding: . import random random_number = random.randint(1,100) print(random_number) . 49 . def randomlist(): list = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;, &quot;blueberry&quot;] element = random.choice(list) print(element) randomlist() . blueberry .

Unit 3.14 Libraries Lesson . Here is our lesson about libraries! . Purpose: Help students streamline and make their coding experience easier through built in packages and methods from a library Objective: By the end of the lesson, students should be able to fluently use methods from the turtle and math packages, and be able to look up documentation for any python package and us it. . fill in the blanks! . Libraries . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | Extra Notes . libraries need to be installed or imported before being used | Packages allow user to import methos from a library | Libraries come with documentation (like a guide to their syntax) | . import random as rd print(rd.randint(1,5)) from random import randint randint(1,5) from random import randint as ri ri(1,5) from random import * print(randint(1,5)) . 3 2 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python __ library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Commands . forward(pixels) | . right(degrees) | . left(degrees) | . setpos(x,y) | . speed(speed) | . pensize(size) | . pencolor(color) | . Note: Color should be within quotes, like &quot;brown&quot;, or &quot;red&quot; . from turtle import * oogway = Turtle() import turtle turtle.bgcolor(&#39;light blue&#39;) turtle.speed(2) for i in range(20): turtle.circle(3*i) turtle.circle(-3*i) turtle.left(i) . Challenge 3: Math . The math package allows for some really cool mathematical methods! . methods Action . ceil(x) | _input decimal number, returns the next highest integer__ | . floor(x)_ | rounds to largest intefer less than or equal to x | . factorial(x) | returns the factorial_ | . gcd(x,y)_ | returns the greatest common denominator of x and y, cant be decimals | . lcm(x,y) | returns least common multiple | . Challenge: Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! Documentation | . from math import * x = input(&quot;Insert your first number:&quot;) y = input(&quot;Insert your second number:&quot;) xfloat = floor(float(x)) yfloat = floor(float(y)) xceil = ceil(float(x)) yceil = ceil(float(y)) gcdv = gcd(xfloat, yfloat) xfac = factorial(xfloat) yfac = factorial(yfloat) print(&#39;Each number rounded down:&#39;, xfloat ,&quot; and &quot;, yfloat) print(&#39;Each number rounded up:&#39;, xceil ,&quot; and &quot;, yceil) print(&#39;GCD:&#39;, gcdv) print(&#39;Each numbers factorial :&#39;, xfac ,&quot; and &quot;, yfac) . Each number rounded down: 2 and 7 Each number rounded up: 3 and 8 GCD: 1 Each numbers factorial : 2 and 5040 . Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . import turtle import random turtle.bgcolor(&#39;light blue&#39;) x = random.randint(3,10) print(x) length = 15 for i in range(x): turtle.forward(length) turtle.right(360/x) turtle.forward(length) .",

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the next power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) . Index: False . Challenges and Homework . You have one homework problem. . Yes just one. . Don&#39;t get excited though. . Problem: Given a specific integer N, return the square root of N (R) if N is a perfect square, otherwise, return the square root of N rounded down to the nearest integer . Input: N (Integer) . Output: R (Integer) . Constraints: Do not use any built-in math operations such as sqrt(x) or x**(0.5), Try complete the problem in logarithmic time. . Hint 1: Maybe you can use Binary Search to try and reduce the number of checks you have to perform? . Hint 2: Is there a mathematical pattern amongst numbers and their square roots that could help you reduce the number of searches or iterations you must execute? Is there some value or rule you can set before applying binary search to narrow the range of possible values? . Run the very last code segment below to load test cases and submission function . def sqrt_trial(N): numlist = [] num = 0 lo = 0 while num &lt;= N: numlist.append(num) num = num + 1 else: hi = num mid = (lo + hi) / 2 for mid in numlist: if mid**2 == N: return mid elif mid**2 &lt; N: hi = mid mid = (hi-lo)/2 elif mid**2 &gt; N: lo = mid mid = (hi-lo)/2 sqrt_trial(169) . 13 . The fucntion sqrt trial worked, but It will not work with higher numbers since it will have to search through a longer list. It was a good start but because of this I had to find a way to do binary search without using a list . def sqrt(N): hi = N lo = 0 if N &gt; 1: hi = N // 2 while hi &gt;= lo: mid = (lo + hi) // 2 if (mid**2) == N: return mid elif (mid**2) &lt; N: lo = mid + 1 else: hi = mid - 1 return None print(sqrt(169)) . 13 . from math import sqrt as sq test_cases = [0,1,4,85248289,22297284,18939904,91107025,69122596,9721924,37810201,1893294144,8722812816,644398225] answers = [int(sq(x)) for x in test_cases] def checkValid(): for i in range(len(test_cases)): if sqrt(test_cases[i]) == answers[i]: print(&quot;Check number {} passed&quot;.format(i+1)) else: print(&quot;Check number {} failed&quot;.format(i+1)) checkValid() .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 . Convert the result back to decimal: 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 -&gt; 192.168.0.0 | The network address is 192.168.0.0 . function convert(num) { if (num &gt;= 1) { convert(num) % 2; } console.log(num % 2, end = &#39; &#39;) } convert(4); . evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:1 function convert(num) { ^ RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:1:17) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) at convert (evalmachine.&lt;anonymous&gt;:3:9) . num = int(input(&quot;Enter a decimal number to be converted into binary.&quot;)) def convert(num): if num &gt;= 1: convert(num // 2) # double slash : divide the first number by the second, rounds to the nearest integer print(num % 2, end = &#39;&#39;) # end = &#39;&#39; signifies what will come between each printed num # Driver Code print(&quot;Binary of num &quot; + str(num) + &quot; is:&quot;, end=&quot; &quot;) convert(num) .",

            "content": "Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks. Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs. To solve the same problem, many different algorithms can be used. . Therefore, algorithms are very important for programmers, and today we&#39;re going to explore how to determine the outcome of algorithms, how to deteremine the output of similar algorithms, how to edit existing algorithms, and how to develop our own algorithms. . Determine the outcome of algorithms . Consider the following algorithm. . def mystery(num, num2): if (num % num2 == 0): print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) mystery(20, 4) . True . What does the algorithm do? Please explain in words. This algorithm takes the input of num and num2 and sees if num is divisible by num2. If true then output is true. Else the output is false. | What if I put in 30 as num and 4 as num2. What would be the output? The output would be false because 30 is not divisible by 4. | Determine the outcome of similar algorithms . What is the output of this algorithm? . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;I will go outside&quot;) else: print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside . What is the output of this algorithm? it looks similar but the output is different! To make them the same output you could use an elif statement instead of three consequent if statements. . temp = 95 if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;it is too hot outside&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;i will go outside&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;it is too cold outside&quot;) . it is too hot outside i will go outside . Editing Algorithms . Task: Please edit the algorithm above to have it yield the same results as the previous algorithm! (no matter what temp you put in) . Developing Algorithms . To develop algorithms, we first need to understand what the question is asking. Then, think about how you would approach it as a human and then try to find what pattern you went through to arrive at the answer. Apply this to code, and there you have it! An algorithm! . Let&#39;s say you wanted to sum up the first five integers. How would you do this in real life? Your thought process would probably be: . The sum of the first integer is 1. | Then, increase that integer by 1. I now add 2 to my existing sum (1). My new sum is 3. | Repeat until I add 5 to my sum. The resulting sum is 15. | . Now let&#39;s translate this into code. . sum = 0 # start with a sum of 0 for i in range (1, 6): # you will repeat the process five times for integers 1-5 sum = sum + i # add the number to your sum print(sum) # print the result . 15 . Task: Write an algorithm in python that sums up the first 5 odd integers. You can use the following code as a starter. . sum = 0 for i in range(10): if i % 2 == 1: sum = sum + i print(sum) . 25 . Homework . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from the Collatz Conjecture. The COllatz Conjecture is as follows: . start with any positive integer | if the number is even, divide by 2 | if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1 | repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach 1 | Example: if the starting number was 6, the output would be 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 . def function(num): list = [] list.append(num) while num &gt; 1: if num % 2: num = num * 3 + 1 list.append(num) else: num = num//2 list.append(num) print(list) function(6) .

Computing innovation: integrates the use of a program in order to function | Collaboration is necessary in order to avoid bias, and have new perspectives in development. This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3 | Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building | Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors | Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group | You can collaborate using repl, github, shared doc, comments in code | . 1.2 Program Function and Purpose . All computing innovations are developed for a purpose and this purpose guides the development of the program | Computer programs take inputs in a variety of fashions to influence the program’s behavior | Computer programs: collection of statements that are executed according to the rules of the programming language Row 1: Program Purpose and Function . | Input: Artist Name and Album | Output: Album duration, album song names, number of songs, album cover photo The purpose of this program is to provide users with data about their favorite artists including their albums, songs, and album duration and allow them to choose their favorite artists. | . 1.3 Program Design and Development . Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to achieve a desired purpose | Programs are developed by groups of people and new prgrams are often written by expaning on the programs already written by others | Programmers can use comments/ documentation (short descriptions) to explain the purpose of their program to themselves, collaboraters, and others involved Row 2: Data Abstraction . Data about song and artists stored in dictionary which is retrieved using API . | . Row 3: Managing Complexity . use a function to read user input and only provide wanted album information allowing user to use favorites tab to organize the artists they enjoy . Row 4: Procedural Abstraction . using artist[album], retrieve only wanted data from the dictionary. call developed function to run based on user input. . Row 5: Algorithm Implementation . develop algorithim to count number of songs in album given API data algorithm to create ‘favorite artists’ tab, where users - can select their favorite artists to be saved in a seperate section of the application . Row 6: Testing . Input multiple artists and album. See if each selected data type displays proper data. Add artists to ‘favorites’ and see if that data is stored . 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors . Errors are inevitable, they happen | Understanding the different types of errors is important to being a proficient programmer | To understand errors, programmers need to create testing schemes to ensure programs are working as intented Identifying and Correcting Errors practice | .",

Our was about music which is something we were passionate about and others were as well. Our project had interactive elements but may have been too personal. We recieved alot of feedback and features that we could have added. It is important to present your project and hear from multiple users and gain perspective to create a product that is universal and lacks bias. . Seeing Other’s Projects . Seeing other people’s projects was just as good of an experience. Peoples ideas and passions really shone through. Visually many projects were satisfying to look at and many had user interaction. But most importantly, seeing other’s ideas gave us ideas for improvement in our own project. Getting inspiration from others is always helpful. . Final Reflection . Overall Night of the Museum was a really helpful learning experience. Getting user feedback and gaining inspiration are all part of the process of creating a successful final product. In the future, I now know that utilizing user feedback into my decisions while creating products is important.

AppLab Creation | Personality Quiz . | Program Purpose This purpose of this program is to test the user’s ability to recognize popular luxury brand logos. | Program Functionality This program consists of three questions in order to quiz the user on their ability to recognize logos. It starts at the home page and navigates through each question page. If the answer selected is wrong, the program leads the user to an ‘incorrect’ question that allows the user to either retry the question or get a hint. The last screen desplays the results of the quiz. | Program Testing I tested this program multiple times. At first I did not use hints and realized that for someone without knowledge of brands, not having hints or retries could be discouraging. Also, the score calculator was not displaying because the if statement was not under an ‘on event statement’. After changing this and reassigning score values to each answer I got better results. App Planning - Logos Quiz . | Home page (introduces quiz, leads to q1) | Q1: question with four options A B C D. If correct answer isn’t chosen, lead user to ‘incorrect’ page. Incorrect page displays that the user input was incorrect and has option to return to the question or recieve a hint. When correct answer choice is clicked, leads to ‘correct’ page which leads to question 2. | Q2: choose between four image options using check box. If correct answer isn’t checked, lead user to ‘incorrect’ page. Incorrect page displays that the user input was incorrect and has option to return to the question or recieve a hint. When correct answer choice is clicked, leads to ‘correct’ page which leads to question 2. | Q3: choose between two images. If incorrect, lead to incorrect page and option to return to question | . Additions . Successes: use of correct/incorrect pages, check boxs | Failures: tried to use a for loop but wasn’t able to because when looped the incorrect answers had to go to different pages based on the question that was incorrect, drop down failed because dropdown only changed the screen and did not give an output | Adjustments: could not use the dropdown so I used the checkbozes instead. Loops did not work due to the fact that each user input needed specific screen changes. So I did not use loops. Ideally I would have figured out the loops because the code was very long. | . Extra . created a second quiz inspired by buzzfeed quix | created a series of questions that determine whether you are an introvert or extrovert | I created a variable ‘score’ and for whichever answer I added/subtracted it a specific value to be added to var score. | In the end I used an if/else statement and said that if score was greater than 0, to display the score and ‘introvert’ | .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
