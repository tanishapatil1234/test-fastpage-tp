<ul>
  <li>Computing innovation: integrates the use of a program in order to function</li>
  <li>Collaboration is necessary in order to avoid bias, and have new perspectives in development. This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3</li>
  <li>Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building</li>
  <li>Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors</li>
  <li>Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group</li>

<p>I didn’t have trouble with any specific problem but I found this one to be a little challenging to understand at first: 
<img src="/test-fastpage-tp/images/q3.png" alt="" title="https://tanishapatil1234.github.io/test-fastpage-tp/" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>I have a better understanding of this problem now that I have gone over it but to summarize:</li>
  <li>It returns a copy of numList with j and k switched. Both J and K need to be between 1 and the length of numList (inclusive). The code makes a copy of numList and names it newList. Then the element at newList(j) is switched and instead assigned the element at numList(k). The code only works if j and k are valid within both lists so j and k must be between 1 and the length of the list</li>
  <li>At first I didn’t understand the paramaters j and k had to satisy but it makes more sense after reviewing it</li>
</ul>

<p>Main problem is comprehending college board psuedocode. Review guide on csp website</p>
