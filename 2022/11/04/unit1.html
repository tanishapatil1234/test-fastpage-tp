<ul>
  <li>Computing innovation: integrates the use of a program in order to function</li>
  <li>Collaboration is necessary in order to avoid bias, and have new perspectives in development. This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3</li>
  <li>Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building</li>
  <li>Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors</li>
  <li>Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group</li>
  <li>You can collaborate using repl, github, shared doc, comments in code</li>
</ul>
