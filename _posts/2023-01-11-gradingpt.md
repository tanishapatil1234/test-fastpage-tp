<h2 id="Reflection-3">Reflection 3<a class="anchor-link" href="#Reflection-3"> </a></h2><p>Overall my scores were very similar to the college board scores. One major discrpancy is college board's standards when they ask for a specific explanation. For example, a procedure shoudl be explained so clearly that one could redo it. A lack of detail in the explanations can cause a loss of full points for any section. Also in testing, the program must be tested and must display two different corresponding inputs and outputs. I will ensure to take careful consideration of these things and especially pay attention to details when writing my own descriptions.</p>
