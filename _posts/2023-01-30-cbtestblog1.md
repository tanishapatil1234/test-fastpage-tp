| **Question**                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **My Answer**                                                                | **Difficulties/Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **** | **** | **** | **** | **** | **** | **** |

| 1. Which of the following code segments can be used to move the robot to the gray square along the path indicated by the arrows? ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb1.png)                                                                                               |       ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb2.png)                                                                          | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb3.png)   This is the correct answer. N should be assigned a value one greater than n after the loops. Otherwise, the robot does not reach the right place. Note: read answer choices and their slight difference                               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb4.png)   2. The drawCircle procedure is to be used to draw the following figure on a coordinate grid. Which of the following code segments can be used to draw the figure                                                               | x ← 4
y ← 1
r ← 0
REPEAT 3 TIMES
{
drawCircle(x, y, r)
r ← r + 1
y ← y + 1
} | x ← 4
y ← 1
r ← 0
REPEAT 3 TIMES
{
r ← r + 1
y ← y + 1
drawCircle(x, y, r)
}
This is correct because the r and y values must be incremented before the drawCircle method is called.                                                   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| 3. The figure below shows a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented as a triangle, which is initially facing upward. The robot can move into a white or gray square but cannot move into a black region. ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb5.png)            |             ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb6.png)                                                                    | ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb7.png)   This answer is correct due to the middle block. ** Be more careful when reading code block answers. Try to draw them out.                                                                                                             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
| 4. Programs I and II below are each intended to calculate the sum of the integers from 1 to n. Assume that n is a positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …).
Which of the following best describes the behavior of the two programs? ![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/cb/cb8.png)   | Program II displays the correct sum, but program I does not.                 | Both program I and program II display the correct sum.
I thought the first one did not work. However it does work and this mistake could have been avoided if I took note of how the variable result was affected through the loops.  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |
