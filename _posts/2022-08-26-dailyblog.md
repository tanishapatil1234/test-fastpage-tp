## End of yr reflection - Tanisha Patil
### Skills you have obtained:
Throughout the year , I have gotten many new skills in computer science. I would say I have gained proficiency in Python and learned so many new things about HTML and JS. I have been exposed to so many ideas about programming like. API’s, the SCRUM process, AGILE methodology and more. More importantly I have developed problem-solving abilities by tackling programming challenges throughout the year. I have been forced to step outside of my comfort zone at times to solve problems in ways I have never thought of before. I have learned about data structures, algorithms, software development methodologies, and database management. Overall, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science principles and programming skills, but more importantly I have developed skills in collaboration, time management, and problem solving skills. 
### Highs and lows from the year:
This year has been filled with highs and lows in my computer science journey. On the high side, I have experienced the satisfaction of solving complex programming problems and witnessing my code come to life. I have experienced the ‘high’ of successfully implementing algorithms to solve real-world challenges and have learned to push myself in the hacks. I have noticed that in the beginning I had aimed for the 2.7 but recently I have been really trying to go the extra mi.e.  Collaborating with peers on group projects has also been a highlight.
However, there have also been lows. There were moments of frustration when I encountered challenges in syntax or errors that were unfamiliar to me. Sometimes, managing deadlines and balancing multiple assignments and projects became overwhelming. However, these lows have provided valuable learning experiences.
### Future plans with CompSci:
In the future, I plan to further deepen my knowledge in computer science. I would like to explore specialized areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. I aspire to work on innovative projects that leverage emerging technologies and contribute to advancements in the field. I plan to stay updated with the latest industry trends and continue expanding my skill set . While my major and career path are sort of undecided, I know that computer science will be beneficial to me in whatever I do. 
### Future plans in Education/Career:
In terms of education and career, I have a strong interest in pursuing a master's degree in some engineering/science/math field to expand my knowledge and gain expertise. I aim to work in a challenging  environment where I can apply my skills and contribute to cutting-edge projects. I aspire to take up leadership roles and work on research and development in technology. Also, I am open to exploring opportunities in academia, where I can share knowledge through research as that is something I have enjoyed doing so far. 
### Other:
As a computer science enthusiast, I have developed a passion for promoting inclusivity in the field. I believe in the power of technology to drive positive social change. In the future, I plan to actively participate in initiatives that encourage underrepresented groups to pursue computer science careers. I aim to advocate for inclusivity within the tech industry. Additionally, I plan on staying updated with the latest advancements in computer science ethics .
