## Notes on Collaboration
- Computing innovation: integrates the use of a program in order to function
- Collaboration is necessary in order to avoid bias, and have new perspectives in development. This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3
- Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building
- Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors
- Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group
- You can collaborate using repl, github, shared doc, comments in code

### Updates *
I didn't have trouble with any specific problem but I found this one to be a little challenging to understand at first: 
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/q3.png "https://tanishapatil1234.github.io/test-fastpage-tp/")
- I have a better understanding of this problem now that I have gone over it but to summarize: 
- It returns a copy of numList with j and k switched. Both J and K need to be between 1 and the length of numList (inclusive). The code makes a copy of numList and names it newList. Then the element at newList(j) is switched and instead assigned the element at numList(k). The code only works if j and k are valid within both lists so j and k must be between 1 and the length of the list
- At first I didn't understand the paramaters j and k had to satisy but it makes more sense after reviewing it
