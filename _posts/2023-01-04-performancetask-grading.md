## Grading 1
| Reporting Category 	| My Score 	| College Board Score 	| Comments 	|
|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Program Purpose/ Function 	| 1 	| 0	| The person did not distinguish between program purpose and functionality. The person only described functionality  	|
| Data Abstraction 	| 1 	| 1 	| Includes two code segments, implements a list for a desired function	|
| Managing Complexity 	| 0 	| 0 	| The provided explanation did not support how the use of a list would manage the program’s complexity. The use of a list did not have any benefit or advantage to fixing errors in the code over something else such as a variable.  	|
| Procedural Abstraction 	| 1 	| 1 	| A procedure, ratioCalculate was defined and called. Person also described how the procedure is used and relted to the overall function of the program. |
| Algorithm Implementation 	| 1 	| 1 	| Program uses all three: sequencing,selection (if), and iteration (through a list) 	|
| Testing 	| 1 	| 1 	| Program is tests and when functions are called they properly run. 	|

## Grading 2

|---	|---	|---	|---	|
| Program Purpose/ Function 	| 1 	| 1 	| The person distinguished<br>between program purpose and <br>functionality. Had a clear purpose <br>and clear function.  	|
| Data Abstraction 	| 1 	| 1 	| mplements three lists: startGrid, <br>currentGrid and nextGrid.  	|
| Managing Complexity 	| 1 	| 1 	| The provided explanation<br>supports how the use of a list<br>would manage the program's <br>complexity by explaining how the<br>use of variables or other resources <br>would be inefficient. The use of a list <br>did have great benefit. 	|
| Procedural Abstraction 	| 1 	| 1 	| A procedure, resetall<br>was defined and called. <br>The function is used to <br>simply reset the game. Also, <br>newGen was defined which copies<br>information from the old generation to <br>the new one.  	|
| Algorithm Implementation 	| 1 	| 1 	| Program uses all three: sequencing, <br>selection (if), and iteration (through <br>a list) 	|
| Testing 	| 1 	| 1 	| Program is tests and when functions are<br>called they properly run. Clearly describe <br>results in written report as well.  	|
