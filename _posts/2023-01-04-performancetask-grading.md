| Program Purpose/ Function | 1        | 0                   | The person did not distinguish<br>between program purpose and <br>functionality. The person only <br>described functionality.                                                                                                                               |
| Data Abstraction          | 1        | 1                   | Includes two code segments, <br>implements a list for a desired <br>function                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Managing Complexity       | 0        | 0                   | The provided explanation did<br>not support how the use of a list<br>would manage the program's <br>complexity. The use of a list <br>did not have any benefit or <br>advantage to fixing errors in the<br>code over something else such as<br>a variable.  |
| Procedural Abstraction    | 1        | 1                   | A procedure, ratioCalculate <br>was defined and called. Person also <br>described how the procedure is used and<br>relted to the overall function of the <br>program                                                                                        |
| Algorithm Implementation  | 1        | 1                   | Program uses all three: sequencing, <br>selection (if), and iteration (through <br>a list)                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Testing                   | 1        | 1                   | Program is tests and when functions are<br>called they properly run.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Program Purpose/ Function | 1        | 1                   | The person distinguished<br>between program purpose and <br>functionality. Had a clear purpose <br>and clear function.                                                                                                                       |
| Data Abstraction          | 1        | 1                   | mplements three lists: startGrid, <br>currentGrid and nextGrid.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Managing Complexity       | 1        | 1                   | The provided explanation<br>supports how the use of a list<br>would manage the program's <br>complexity by explaining how the<br>use of variables or other resources <br>would be inefficient. The use of a list <br>did have great benefit. |
| Procedural Abstraction    | 1        | 1                   | A procedure, resetall<br>was defined and called. <br>The function is used to <br>simply reset the game. Also, <br>newGen was defined which copies<br>information from the old generation to <br>the new one.                                 |
| Algorithm Implementation  | 1        | 1                   | Program uses all three: sequencing, <br>selection (if), and iteration (through <br>a list)                                                                                                                                                   |
| Testing                   | 1        | 1                   | Program is tests and when functions are<br>called they properly run. Clearly describe <br>results in written report as well.                                                                                                                 |
