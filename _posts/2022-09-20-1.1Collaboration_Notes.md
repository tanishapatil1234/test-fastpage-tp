## Notes on Collaboration
- Computing innovation: integrates the use of a program in order to function
- Collaboration is necessary in order to avoid bias, and have new perspectives in development. This is clearly shown in the differences between Super Mario Bro 2 and 3
- Collaboration teaches skills like: communication, negotiation, conflict resolution, consensus building
- Pair programming: is when two people work as a pair on a program together. One types code while other observes and looks for errors
- Think Pair Share: is when you think on your own, think with a partner, and then share with a larger group 
- You can collaborate using repl, github, shared doc, comments in code
