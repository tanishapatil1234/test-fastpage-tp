Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation?                                                                    | C. An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Binary is 4-bit meaning the max number represented is 4! = 24. 14+15 = 29 > 24 so 29 cannot be represented                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 20. A video game character can face toward one of four directions: north, south, east, and west. Each direction is stored in memory as a sequence of four bits. A new version of the game is created in which the character can face toward one of eight directions, adding northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast to the original four possibilities. Which of the following statements is true about how the eight directions must be stored in memory? | D. Four bits are enough to store the eight directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | None                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
